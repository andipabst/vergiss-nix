# VergissNix Android App

## Known Bugs
- After deleting the task in the app, the notification for the task still exists
- After changing the date or time for a task, the old notification still exists

## UI improvements
- After saving a task (clicking the tick), the shadow stays visible and the text just vanishes. Maybe add an animation

- Mark tasks as finished instead of just deleting them
- Mark a task as finished directly from the notification
